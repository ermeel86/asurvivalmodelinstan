# A Survival Model in Stan

A case study (tutorial) that explains how to implement a proportional hazard survival model in Stan, while following the essentials of a robust Bayesian workflow.

We admit (and are well aware of the fact) that there a much more powerful and flexible survival models available and some of them are event already implemented in Stan, however the primary target audience of this case study are novices to Bayesian Survival Models; the author believes that the implemented proportional hazard model with constant baseline hazard is the simplest stepping stone from frequentist survival models to the multiverse of Bayesian survival models.
